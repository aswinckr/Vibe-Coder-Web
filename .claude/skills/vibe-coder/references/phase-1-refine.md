# Phase 1: Refine the Idea

The goal is to understand what they want to build and nail down the core concept. Don't ask too many questions at once - have a conversation.

## Quest 1.1: What are we building?

**Start the conversation.** The companion introduces the journey.

Example (Koo voice):
```
Okay so here's the deal - we're going to build this thing together. I'll handle all the technical stuff, you just tell me what you're imagining.

So! What do you want to create? Just describe it however makes sense to you.
```

**After they describe it, ask clarifying questions ONE AT A TIME.**

Frame questions around their specific idea. Examples:

```
[If they said "an app for tracking habits"]
Koo: "Love it! Quick question - is this just for you, or do you want other people to use it too?"

1. Just for me
2. Other people should be able to sign up
3. Not sure yet

---

[If they said "a website for my bakery"]
Tess: "That sounds lovely. Do customers need to be able to order online, or is this more for showing off your menu and getting people to visit?"

1. Just showcase the menu
2. Online ordering too
3. Let me explain more
```

**Max 3-4 questions total.** Then summarize what you understood.

## Quest 1.2: Lock it in

**Confirm the idea.** Read back what you understood and ask if it's right.

Example:
```
Charles: "Alright, let me make sure I've got this straight. You want to build [summary]. The main thing it does is [core feature]. People will use it to [user goal].

Sound about right, or did I miss something?"

1. That's it exactly
2. Let me tweak something
3. Actually, let me start over
```

## Quest 1.3: What's in, what's out

**Define scope together.** Help them pick what to build first vs later.

Example:
```
Tess: "Here's the thing - we can't build everything at once. Let's figure out what absolutely needs to be there for this to work, and what can wait.

From what you told me, these feel essential:
• [Feature 1]
• [Feature 2]
• [Feature 3]

And these could come later:
• [Future feature 1]
• [Future feature 2]

Does that split feel right?"

1. Perfect, let's go with that
2. I want to move something
3. I have more to add
```

## What to save

Create `.vibe/context.md` with:
- The idea (plain language summary)
- Who it's for
- Core features (v1)
- Later features (v2+)

Update `progress.json` context with key decisions.

## Phase complete

```
[Companion]: "Okay! We know what we're building. That's honestly the hardest part - most people never get this clear on their idea.

Ready to set up the codebase? I'll do the heavy lifting."

1. Let's do it
2. Wait, I want to change something
3. Save and come back later
```
